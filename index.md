## Travel

If you plan on flying, take a look at the [nearby airports][airports]. We recommend flying into [Newark Airport (EWR)][EWR]. It is the closest major airport that doesn't require you to sit through bridge/tunnel traffic.

Although you can take a $45 cab ride from EWR to Suffern, you may be better off [renting a car][rent]. As mentioned above, we will provide transportation between the hotel and the venue before/after the wedding day events.

### Need a hotel or travel buddy?

[Email Abhay](mailto:ark3@email.com) and we'll try to sync you up.

## Where's your wedding registry?

... about that. We don't have one. We'd appreciate it if you didn't bring boxed gifts. As most of you are aware, we recently merged two apartments into one. And itâ€™s _full_. In addition, we will not have room in the car to transport boxed gifts along with us on our mini-moon trip. However, we will have space for cards. ðŸ˜‰
